# Assignment_0

Folder structure is as follows:

Each task in the assignment follows a structure of containing an ubber directory and shall be run from the inside of that directory or the command used for the run of the file, shall contain the path to the exact file. I have chosen this way of structure due to the fact that i wanted to contain the assignment in one repository and maintain a nice looking structure, which is easily accessed from a later time.
